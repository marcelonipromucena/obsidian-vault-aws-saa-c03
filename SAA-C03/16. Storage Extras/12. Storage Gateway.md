- Hybrid Cloud for Storage
- Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data.
-  S3 is a proprietary storage technology from AWS. How can we expose S3 data to on-premises?
	- ==AWS Storage Gateway!==
- ### Why?
	- Long cloud migrations
	- Security requirements
	- Compliance requirements
	- IT strategy
- ### What options do i have?
	- **Block**: Using **EBS**![[Arch_Amazon-Elastic-Block-Store_16.svg]] or **Instance Store**
	- **File:** Using **EFS**![[Arch_Amazon-EFS_16.png]] or **FSx**![[Arch_Amazon-FSx_16.png]]
	- **Object:** Using **S3**![[Arch_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_16.png]] or **Glacier**![[Arch_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service-Glacier_16.png]]
- ### Use cases?
	- Disaster recovery
	- Backup & restore
	- Tiered storage
	- On-premises cache & low-latency files access
- ### Types
	- S3 File Gateway![[Res_AWS-Storage-Gateway_Amazon-S3-File-Gateway_48.png]]
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">NFS</mark> and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SMB (this one with AD support for auth)</mark> 
		- Supports:
			- S3 Standard![[Res_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_S3-Standard_48.png]]
			- S3 Standard IA![[Res_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_S3-Standard-IA_48.png]]
			- S3 One Zone IA![[Res_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_S3-One-Zone-IA_48.png]]
			- S3 Intelligent Tiering![[Res_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_S3-Intelligent-Tiering_48.png]]
		- Transition to S3 Glacier using a **Lifecycle Policy**.
		- IAM roles for each File Gateway

	- FSx File Gateway ![[Res_AWS-Storage-Gateway_Amazon-FSx-File-Gateway_48.png]]
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SMB</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">NTFS</mark>, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Active Directory</mark>...
		- Native access to FSx for Windows
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Local cache for Frequently Accessed Data</mark>
		- Useful group file sharing and home directories.

	- Volume Gateway![[Res_AWS-Storage-Gateway_Volume-Gateway_48.png]]
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">iSCSI</mark> backed by S3
		- **EBS** **snapshots** which can help restore on-premise volumes!
		- **Cached volumes** has low latency access to<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> most recent data</mark>
		- **Stored volumes** your entire dataset is **on-premise** with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">scheduled backups to S3</mark>
	- Tape Gateway![[Res_AWS-Storage-Gateway_Tape-Gateway_48 1.png]]
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">iSCSI</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes.</mark>
		- Tape Gateway = same process but in the cloud.
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Virtual Tape Library (VTL)</mark> backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier.
		- Back up data using existing tape-based processes 
		- Works with leading backup software vendors.
	- Hardware Appliance
		- Used if your on-premise doesn't have virtualization.
		- You can buy it on amazon.com
			- 5TB cache = US$ 12,360
			- 12TB cache = US$ 18,499
		- Works with **File Gateway, Volume Gateway, Tape Gateway.**
		- Has all resource requirements.
		- Helpful for daily NFS backups in small DCs.
