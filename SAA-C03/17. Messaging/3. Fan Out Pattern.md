- You can push a message to an SNS topic and it will "copy-spread" the message through all SQS queues that are subscribers of that SNS.
- Fully decoupled, no data loss.
- SQS allows for:
	- Data persistence
	- Delayed processing
	- Retries of Work
- Ability to add more SQS subscribers over time
- Make sure your SQS queue **access policy** allows for SNS to write.
- Cross-Region Delivery: works with SQS queues in other regions
- You can have a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">filter policy</mark> in your SNS to filter message and send them to specific SQS queues.
