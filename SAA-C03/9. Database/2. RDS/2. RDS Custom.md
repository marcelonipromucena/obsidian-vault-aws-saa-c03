- Managed **Oracle** and **Microsoft SQL** Server Database with **OS and DB Customization**
- RDS: Automates setup, operation, and scaling of database in AWS
- Custom: Access to the underlying database and OS so you can:
	- Configure settings
	- Install patches
	- Enable native features
	- Access the underlying EC2 instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager
- ==De-activate Automation Mode== to perform your customization, better to take a DB snapshot before.

### RDS vs RDS Custom

**RDS**: Entire DB and OS is ==managed by AWS==
**RDS Custom**: ==full admin access== to the underlying OS and the database.
