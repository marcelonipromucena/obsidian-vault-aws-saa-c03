- Automated Backups:
	- Daily **full backup** of the db (during the backup window).
	- Transaction logs are backed up by RDS **every 5 minutes**
	- Ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
	- **==1 to 35 days of retention==**, set 0 to disable automated backups
- Manual DB Snapshots:
	- Manually triggered by the user
	- Retention of backup for as long as you want
- Trick: in a stopped RDS database, you will **still** **pay** **for** **storage**. If you plan on stopping it for a long time, ==you should snapshot & restore instead==.
