## Scenario 01
- Company uses S3 to store images;
- Images are kept **encrypted** in s3;
- Company uses **KMS** and manages its own CMK (Customer Master Key) for encryption;
- DevOps member accidentally deleted the CMK a day ago;
- >cant-recover-images.jpg
- What should they do?
- Answer:
	- CMK **cannot be recovered by ROOT user**;
	- **Contacting AWS** won't solve this since they can't recover the key aswell;
	- <mark class="hltr-green">CMK stays in 'pending deletion' status for 7 up to 30 days after deletion. Since the key was deleted a day ago you can cancel CMK deletion and recover the key. The default waiting period is 30 days. </mark>
