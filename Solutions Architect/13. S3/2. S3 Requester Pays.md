- In general, bucket owners pay for all S3 **storage** and **data** **transfer** costs associated with their buckets
- With ==Requester Pays buckets==, the requester instead of the bucket owner pays the cost of the request and the data downloaded from the bucket.
- Helpful when you want to share large datasets with other accounts
- The requester must be authenticated in AWS (cannot be anonymous)
