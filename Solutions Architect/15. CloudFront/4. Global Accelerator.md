- You have deployed an application and have global **users who want to access it directly**.
- They go over the public internet, which can add a lot of latency due to many **hops** (**img01**)
- We wish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency.
### Unicast vs Anycast (img02)
- **Unicast IP**: one server holds one IP address.
- **Anycast IP**: all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest
### Global Accelerator
- Leverage the AWS internal network to route to your application
- **2 Anycast IPs** are created for your application
- The Anyucast IP send traffic directly to Edge Locations
- The Edge locations send the traffic to your application (**img03**)
- Works with **Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB, NLB, public or private**
- Consistent Performance
	- Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
	- No issue with client cache (because the IP doesn't change)
	- Internal AWS network
- Health Checks
	- Global Accelerator performs a health check of your applications
	- Helps make your application global (failover less than 1 minute for unhealthy)
- Security
	- only 2 external IP need to be whitelisted
	- DDoS protection thanks to AWS Shield

### Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- **CloudFront**:
	- Improves performance for:
		- Cacheable Content (such as images and videos)
		- Dynamic Content (Such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Content is served at the edge</mark>
- **Global Accelerator**: 
	- Improves performance for a wide range of applications over <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">TPC or UDP</mark>
	- Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
	- Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP.
	- Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
	- Good for HTTP use cases that requires deterministic, fast regional failover.
