- Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and **process data at the edge**, and **migrate data into and out of AWS**

### Data Migration
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge
- Snowmobile
### Edge Computing
- Snowcone
- Snowball Edge

### Data Migration with AWS Snow Family

##### Challenges
- Limited connectivity
- Limited bandwidth
- High network cost
- Shared bandwidth (can't maximize the line)
- Connection stability

**AWS Snow Family: offline devices to perform data migrations**
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!</mark>

### Snowcone & Snowcone SSD
- Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure withstands harsh environments
- Light (2.1Kg)
- Device used for **edge computing, storage and data transfer**
- **Snowcone** - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">8TB of HDD Storage</mark>
- **Snowcone SSD** - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">14TB of SSD Storage</mark>
- Use Snowcone where Snowball does not fit (space-constrained environment)
- Must provide your own battery/cables
- Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data

### Snowball Edge (for data transfer)
- Physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
- Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
- Pay per data transfer job
- Provide block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object
##### Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">80TB of HDD capacity</mark> for block volume and S3 compatible object storage.
#### Snowball Edge Compute Optimized
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">42TB of HDD or 28TB of NVMe capacity</mark> for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
- Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery.

### Snowmobile
- Transfer <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">exabytes of data (1EB = 1,000 PB = **1,000,000 TBs**)</mark>
- Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity(use multiple in parallel)
	- If you need 1 EB of data, you need to order 10 Snowmobiles
- High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB</mark>


### Edge Computing
- Process data while its being created on an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">edge location</mark>
	- A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
- These locations may have:
	- Limited / no internet access
	- Limited / no easy access to computing power
- We setup a **Snowball Edge / Snowcone** device to do edge computing
- Use cases of **Edge Computing:**
	- Preprocess data
	- Machine Learning at the edge
	- Transcoding media streams
- Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)
##### Snow Family - Edge Computing
- **Snowcone & Snowcone SSD (smaller)**:
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">2 CPUs, 4GB of RAM</mark>, wired or wireless access
	- USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
- **Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized**:
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">104 vCPUs, 416GiB of RAM</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Optional GPU</mark> (useful for video processing or machine learning)
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">28 TB NVMe or 42TB HDD</mark> usable storage
	- Storage Clustering available (up to 16 nodes)
- **Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized**: 
	- Up to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">40 vCPUs, 80GiB of RAM, 80TB of storage</mark>
- All: Can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda Functions (using AWS iOt Greengrass)
- Long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing

### AWS OpsHub
- Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">CLI tool</mark>
- Today, you can use **AWS OpsHub** (a software you install on your computer/laptop) to manage your Snow Family Device
	- Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
	- Transferring files
	- Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family Devices
	- Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on your device)
	- Launch compatible AWS services on your devices (ex: Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, Network File System (NFS))
