- Use it if you need to transfer large amounts of data move data to and from:
	- On-prem/other -> AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API)- **needs agent**
	- AWS -> AWS (different storage services) - **no agent needed**
- Can sync with:
	- S3 ![[Res_Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service_S3-Standard_48 1.png]]
	- EFS![[Arch_Amazon-EFS_32.svg]]
	- FSx![[Arch_Amazon-FSx_32.svg]]
- Can schedule replication tasks.
- **File permissions and metadata are preserved** (NFS POSIX, SMB...)
- One agent = 10Gbps.
- Exam asks that they wanna use DataSync <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">but they don't have the network capacity to do so.</mark> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Use AWS Snowcone that comes with agent pre-installed.</mark>
