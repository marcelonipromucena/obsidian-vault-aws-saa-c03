### 1st Pattern
- SQS Queue poll for messages in EC2 instances inside ASG.
- SQS Queue has a metric called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ApproximateNumberOfMessages</mark> that describes how many messages are left to be consumed in a queue
- Metric has an alarm for breach
- Alarm triggers ASG to scale instances.

### 2nd Pattern
- Lets say you have a huge black friday sales
- And databases are overloaded and you're in risk of losing database transactions and therefore losing sales.
- We can use <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">SQS as a buffer to database writes</mark>
- SQS infinitely scales, therefore you can write stuff to SQS queue and then have EC2 instances that "dequeue messages" from the queue by consuming messages and writing/inserting data into database.

### 3rd Pattern
- You can use SQS queues to decouple aplication tiers, e.g.: frontend from backend.
- Requests come from Frontend to an SQS Queue that lately the backend will process, making it an asynchronous process.
