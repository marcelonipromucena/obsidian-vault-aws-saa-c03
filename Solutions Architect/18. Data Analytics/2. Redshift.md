### Basic Information
- Based on PostgreSQL, but isnt for <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">OLTP (Online TRANSACTIONAL Processing)</mark>
- It's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">OLAP (Online ANALYTICAL Processing</mark>
- 10x better performance than other Data Warehouses.
- Can scale to PBs of data.
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Columnar storage</mark> instead of row based & parallel query engine.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Pay as you go</mark> based on the instance provisioned.
- Has SQL Interface;
- Integration with QuickSight or Tableau;
- **vs Athena:**
	- faster queries;
	- faster joins;
	- faster aggregations;
	- all thanks to indexes (that Athena don't have);

### Cluster
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Leader Node:</mark> for query planning, result aggregation;
- <mark style="background: #ef6c00">Compute node: </mark> for performing the queries, send results to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">leader node</mark>;
- You provision the node size in advance;
- You can use <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reserve Instances</mark> for cost savings;

### Snapshot and Disaster Recover
- Has "Multi-AZ" for some clusters;
- Snapshots are PITR of the cluster, stored in S3;
- Snapshots are incremental (only what has changed is saved);
- You can restore a snapshot into a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">new cluster</mark>
- Automated: e.g.: every 8 hours; every 5GB; scheduled, etc. ..
- Manual: snapshot is retained until you delete it;
- You can configure Redshift to automatically copy snapshots (automated or manual) to another AWS Region;


### Redshift Spectrum
- Query data that is already in S3 without loading it;
- Must have a Redshift cluster available to start the query
- The query is thensubmitted to thousand of Redshift Spectrum nodes;
