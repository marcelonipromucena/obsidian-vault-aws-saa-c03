- Create a new Aurora DB Cluster from an existing one
- Faster than snapshot & restore
- Uses **copy-on-write** protocol
	- Initially, the new DB cluster uses the same data volume as the original DB cluster (fast and efficient - no copying is needed)
	- When updates are made to the new DB cluster data, then additional storage is allocated and data is copied to be separated
- Very fast & cost-effective
- **Useful to create a "staging" database from a "production" database without impacting the production database**
