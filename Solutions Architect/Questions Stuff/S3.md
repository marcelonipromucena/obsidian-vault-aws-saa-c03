##### Scenario 01
- NASA scientist is trying to upload high-res image to S3;
- Image size is 3GB;
- He is using S3 Transfer Acceleration;
- S3TA did not result in an accelerated transfer;
- How AWS would charge this image transfer?
- Answer:
	- Cannot be any option that says "**AWS charges S3 transfer for the image upload.**"
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">AWS won't charge for the image upload, because with S3TA you pay ONLY for transfers that ARE INDEED accelerated.</mark>

##### Scenario 02 - Security
- Company is build an application;
- It will deal with **sensitive health information**;
- Backups of the user data **must be kept encrypted in S3**;
- Company does not want to **provide its own encryption keys**;
- **But** still wants to **maintain an audit trail of when an encryption key _was used and by whom_**;
- Which is the best solution?
- Answer:
	- Can't be **client-side encryption** since company doesn't want to provide its own encryption keys;
	- Can't be **SSE-S3** since company wants to maintain an audit trail and with SSE-S3 each object is encrypted with an **_unique key_**;
	- Can't be **SSE-C** since you can't audit trail the usage of the encryption keys, and the company doesn't want to provide its own encryption keys;
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">SSE-KMS is the right answer since it takes away the need for the company to provide its own keys AND you can maintain an audit trail of when the key was used and by whom.</mark>
